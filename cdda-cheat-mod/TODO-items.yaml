        #         * it is armor (i.e. wearable)
        #         * it is at least 250mL in volume

        #       If there are multiple matching items, it says "pile of clothes", even if the "clothes" are sleeping bags and blankets.
        #       Being in a vehicle also plays a factor - I *think* it's just saying that it'll consider clothes stored inside the vehicle's cargo space, without you having to physically move the blanket from the cargo bay to the driver's seat.
        #       So it doesn't have to be a
        #       sleeping bag (1000mL / 80warm) or
        #       blanket (1550ml / 50warm),
        #       really, it could be e.g. a
        #       zentai (500ml / 20warm) or
        #       t-shirt (500mL / 5warm) or
        #       survivor trenchcoat (700mL / 20warm)
        #       But the sleeping bag's warmth is much better than the others, so that probably helps.
