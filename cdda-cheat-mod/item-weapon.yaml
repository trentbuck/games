# I like playing with perk_bloody_mess mutation, so
# I do not have to pulp zombies.
# That sends splatter EVERYWHERE, so
# then I end up swapping to a mop to clear that away.
# It'd be nice if my gun had a mop attachment to do that continuously...

      description:
        The 9mm SUB CQB was developed with personal defense in mind.
        Integrated noise suppression offers a tactical advantage while protecting the defender from decibel chaos.
        We highly recommend you utilize the integrated picatinny rails.
        Add a combat light and quality optic to this quiet little protector for positive threat identification and target acquisition.
