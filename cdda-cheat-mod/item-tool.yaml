# Adding this into the sonic screwdriver was too messy.
# Specifically, as at 0.H, the repair_metal and repair_fabric items *MUST* be on an item that consumes charges.
# If they are not, then after choosing the item to repair, 0.H segfaults, because the C++ code *assumes* this.
# (The segfault happens somewhere in repair_item_finish(), but I didn't work out exactly where.)
#
# This is distinct from e.g. metal_cut, which is normally on oxyacetylene torches (consuming oxyacetylene), but
# does not HAVE TO be.
# But if I make the sonic_screwdriver use charges -- even if it is *zero* charges, then
# I get an extra prompt every single time for every other action than repair_fabric and repair_metal.
#
# Regarding the name: I was trying to think of a "taste" instead of a "sound" screwdriver, but
# I didn't like "gustatory screwdriver".  I started thinking about other senses organs like the halteres, and
# settled for now on "precession screwdriver" as that is how the halteres operate.
# UPDATE: then I thought about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977%E2%80%931980_Florida_orange_juice_boycott
#         so now it's a virgin screwdriver / tonic screwdriver.
#         Unfortunately you can't do material:[vodka,oj] because they're items, not materials.
#         Also note that there exists id:drink_screwdriver in the game already.
#         I thought about making this copy-from that, but I'm worried I'd accidentally drink my tool.

# Adding this into the sonic screwdriver was too messy.
# Specifically it's fiddly to replace "turn off" with "turn on",
# without removing all the other use_actions.
# Also considered:
#   * stick with bio_flashlight
#   * just use heavy_flashlight and scavenge batteries
#   * same thing but wearable instead of transformable
#     (that requires a custom enchantment which
#     may not count as "voluntary" light for e.g. crafting,
#     in the C++ hard-coded checks).
