# To automatically use a lockpick when hitting "e" on a door,
# you need one of:
#  * bio_lockpick (hardcoded in C++)
#  * explicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK
#  * implicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK due to type:TOOL + qualities:LOCKPICK
# You get a "use <item>?" prompt EXCEPT FOR the bio_lockpick, so
# for convenience it might be best to just keep that implant.
# Also, bio_lockpick doesn't currently conflict with any mutations, which
# is/was a major reason to avoid them.
