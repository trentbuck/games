# To automatically use a lockpick when hitting "e" on a door,
# you need one of:
#  * bio_lockpick (hardcoded in C++)
#  * explicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK
#  * implicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK due to type:TOOL + qualities:LOCKPICK
# You get a "use <item>?" prompt EXCEPT FOR the bio_lockpick, so
# for convenience it might be best to just keep that implant.
# Also, bio_lockpick doesn't currently conflict with any mutations, which
# is/was a major reason to avoid them.
# - type: ITEM
#   subtypes:
#    - TOOL
#   qualities:
#     - [LOCKPICK, 40]
#   flags:
#     - PERFECT_LOCKPICK



# Likewise the bio_syringe has a coded-in-C++ bonus that you can't get
# from any json (15s to inject vs. 300s w/ clean syringe).
# And no mutation conflicts.


# Likewise the bio_fitnessband (or fitness_band) has a coded-in-C++
# bonus that you can't apply to custom items.
# use_action: [FITNESS_CHECK, CALORIES_INTAKE_TRACKER]
# Let you get similar information, but
# it is not displayed directly from the (E)at menu.
# And no mutation conflicts.

# https://cdda-guide.nornagon.net/item/solarpack_on (flags: SOLARPACK_ON)
# is useless without

# you can't even unfold (activate) it without the implant.

# bio_speed gives +10% movement (same as QUICK); they stack.
# This ends up being a problem if you have followers, because
# you immediately outpace them and can't find one another.

# NOTE: bio_purifier works by simply adding "env_protection: [15, mouth]".
#       Since zagreb armor is already giving 40-80 environment_protection, this is moot.
# - bio_purifier            # no mutation conflicts

# NOTE: I *think* bio_carbon just up-armors all your body parts by ~4, for all damage types except bash.
#       Zagreb armor already provides endgame-tier armor, so meh.
# - bio_carbon               # no mutation conflicts

# bio_meteorologist is hard-coded in C++ to do:
#   - wind power (accounting for vehicle speed)
#   - weather
#   - temperature (THERMOMETER)
#   - humidity (HYGROMETER)
#   - pressure (BAROMETER)
#   - a "feels like" temperature
#   - it does not conflict with anything
# UPDATE: I don't think it provides anything USEFUL, though.
#         Compared to a THERMOMETER/BAROMETER/HYGOMETER-equipped player,
#         nothing visibly changes in the sidebar.


# bio_geiger:
#   - might replace unwrapped radation badge in the sidebar?
#     UPDATE: radiation on sidebar only in "custom" view, and
#     when using that, does NOT check bio_geiger, ONLY flags:RAD_DETECT (rad_badge).
#     The C++ code looks specifically for bio_geiger or rad_badge (not flags:RAD_DETECT).
#     Further, since BADGE irradiation level does not match PLAYER irradiation level, just give this up as Too Hard.
#   - triggers a warning once every 3 minutes if you're being irradiated (hard-coded in C++)
#   - it does not conflict with anything
#   - MOSTLY the only places you get irradiated are the Nuclear Power Plant and the Missile Silo, right?
#     and you JUST KNOW when you go to those places, to watch out for radiation.
