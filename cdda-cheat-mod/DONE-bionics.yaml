# To automatically use a lockpick when hitting "e" on a door,
# you need one of:
#  * bio_lockpick (hardcoded in C++)
#  * explicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK
#  * implicitly have use_action:PICK_LOCK due to type:TOOL + qualities:LOCKPICK
# You get a "use <item>?" prompt EXCEPT FOR the bio_lockpick, so
# for convenience it might be best to just keep that implant.
# Also, bio_lockpick doesn't currently conflict with any mutations, which
# is/was a major reason to avoid them.

# Likewise the bio_syringe has a coded-in-C++ bonus that you can't get
# from any json (15s to inject vs. 300s w/ clean syringe).
# And no mutation conflicts.


# Likewise the bio_fitnessband (or fitness_band) has a coded-in-C++
# bonus that you can't apply to custom items.
# use_action: [FITNESS_CHECK, CALORIES_INTAKE_TRACKER]
# Let you get similar information, but
# it is not displayed directly from the (E)at menu.
# And no mutation conflicts.

# bio_speed gives +10% movement (same as QUICK); they stack.
# This ends up being a problem if you have followers, because
# you immediately outpace them and can't find one another.
