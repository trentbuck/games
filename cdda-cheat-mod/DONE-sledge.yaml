        # Sledges are useful for opening jammed safes and locked metal doors.
        # The alternative would be a rocket launcher, maybe.
        # You can also cut open doors with a cutting torch, BUT
        # if you try that on a jammed gun safe, it'll detonate all the ammo within!
        # NOTE: what actually matters is having a high single-hit bash damage.
        # UPDATE: The heavy sledge was knackering me very quickly, and
        #         didn't seem to get through doors any faster than the short sledge.
        # UPDATE: mace (when made of endgame steel) is actually better than
        #         sledge in terms of stamina &c, and it's pure bash per hit is
        #         only slightly lower.
        # UPDATE: legendary weapon is even better, by a huge margin.
        #         You can use this to smash open *walls*, without
        #         needing to have a cheating STR of 100 (which
        #         immediately causes stamina KO in melee).
