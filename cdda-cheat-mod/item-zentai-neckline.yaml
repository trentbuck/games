# 20:52 <twb> In body graphs, 100% coverage of everything seems to leave torso_neck grey, even though everything else is green
# 20:52 <twb> Am I doing it wrong?
# 20:55 <twb> Example: https://i.imgur.com/nyjqGfV.png
# 20:57 <twb> That zentai is defined as armor: - coverage: 100 covers: head mouth eyes torso arm_l arm_r hand_l hand_r leg_l leg_r foot_l foot_r
# 20:57 <twb> So afaict "torso" doesn't include specifically_covers torso_neck?
# 20:57 <twb> I don't know if this really *matters*, it has just been bugging me in the item view
# 20:59 <twb> Looking in body view ({) under torso, I see that both "waist" and "neck" are empty, but the item viewer seems OK for waist
# 21:00 <twb> also foot bottoms doesn't seem to show up in the body view ({)...
