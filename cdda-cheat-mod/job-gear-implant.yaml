        # By far the most common ammunition is
        # 9mm Luger, 5.56 NATO (and 12g shotgun).
        # Have one tricked-out weapon of each.
        # It should take common mags (Glock, STANAG).
        # The mags should be the biggest without a hidden jam penalty.
        # As at 0.H, "night raids" are long gone, so fuck suppressors (MP5SD)?
        # As I have a debug backpack, ignore burst/auto - rather than rapid fire,
        # I will simply switch to a bigger gun.
        # Try to have 300 rounds of magazines for each calibre.
