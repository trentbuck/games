# Once I found a folding bicycle, and found it very handy for short trips.
# It is faster than walking, and more maneouverable and sustainable than a car.
# Folding means when you start walking again, you can fold it (vehicle -> item).
# A unicycle is even better, but it can only spawn as a vehicle, not an item.
# I fixed that by defining my own pre-folded one.
# Mainline alternatives are:
#
#   • folded_bicycle (0.G and later)
#   • folded_skateboard_generic (0.H and later)
