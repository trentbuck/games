  # All positive traits, except those with downsides.
  # DICEMASTER lets you read books easier & faster.
  # SKATER is only useful if you're wearing rollerblades/rollerskates/heelies, which aren't compatible with RM13 full-body combat armor.
  # POLICE/PD_DET/SWAT/FED just prevents flying cameras from whinging at you.
  # These are WELL over the max of 12, but you can pick freeform or single pool.
