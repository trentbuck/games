  ### Bionics stuff ###
  # NOTE: Many CBMs conflict with mutations.
  #       So e.g. if my cheating job gives me bio_ar,
  #       I can't ever have CEPH_VISION, so
  #       I can't become an octopus.
  #       Therefore I *nowadays* think it's probably better to
  #       pre-build a "do everything" custom tool (sonic_screwdriver).
  #       NOTE: they ALSO conflict with some of the traits in job-trait-proficiency-skill.yaml
  # "// MAYBE CBMS":

  #   - bio_climate
  #   - bio_nanobots
  #   - bio_geiger
  #   - bio_blood_anal
  #   NOTE: bio_evap mechanics are hard-coded in C++:
  #             // Aero-Evaporator provides water at 60 watts with 2 L / kWh efficiency
  #             // which is 10 mL per 5 minutes.  Humidity can modify the amount gained.

    - bio_cable  # Get power from solar backpack & running cars. no mutation conflicts
    - bio_ups  # Power laser rifles &c from yourself no mutation conflicts
    - bio_flashlight  # Heavy flashlight (NOTES-illumination.csv) no mutation conflicts
    # FIXME: consider bio_multimeter (split from bio_tools in 0.H, I think?)
    - bio_painkiller            # no mutation conflicts
    # NOTE: bio_purifier works by simply adding "env_protection: [15, mouth]".
    #       Since zagreb armor is already giving 40-80 environment_protection, this is moot.
