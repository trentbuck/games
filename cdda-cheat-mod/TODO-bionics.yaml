  ### Bionics stuff ###
  # NOTE: Many CBMs conflict with mutations.
  #       So e.g. if my cheating job gives me bio_ar,
  #       I can't ever have CEPH_VISION, so
  #       I can't become an octopus.
  #       Therefore I *nowadays* think it's probably better to
  #       pre-build a "do everything" custom tool (sonic_screwdriver).
  #       NOTE: they ALSO conflict with some of the traits in job-trait-proficiency-skill.yaml
  # "// MAYBE CBMS":
  #   - bio_radscrubber
  #   - bio_scent_mask
  #   - bio_remote
  #   - bio_ground_sonar
  #   - bio_climate
  #   - bio_nanobots
  #   - bio_geiger
  #   - bio_blood_anal
  #   NOTE: bio_evap mechanics are hard-coded in C++:
  #             // Aero-Evaporator provides water at 60 watts with 2 L / kWh efficiency
  #             // which is 10 mL per 5 minutes.  Humidity can modify the amount gained.
  #   - bio_evap
  #   - bio_night_vision

bio_meteorologist is hard-coded in C++ to do:
  - wind power (accounting for vehicle speed)
  - weather
  - temperature (THERMOMETER)
  - humidity (HYGROMETER)
  - pressure (BAROMETER)
  - a "feels like" temperature
  - it does not conflict with anything


bio_geiger:
  - might replace unwrapped radation badge in the sidebar?
  - it does not conflict with anything

  #   - bio_meteorologist
  #   - bio_infrared
  #   - bio_memory
  #   # handy to counteract getting winded when pulping corpses???
  #   - bio_gills
  #   - bio_soporific
  #   - bio_taste_blocker
  #   - bio_face_mask
  #   - bio_dex_enhancer
  #   - bio_eye_enhancer
  #   - bio_int_enhancer
  #   - bio_str_enhancer
  #   - bio_membrane
  #   - bio_weight
  #   - bio_power_armor_interface_mkII
  # NOTE: most of these do not auto-activate, e.g. bio_UPS will not start charging your UPS-powered gear
  # "// CBMs replaces…":
  #   bio_fitnessband: smartphone (partially)
  #   bio_watch: smartphone (partially)
  #   bio_lighter: lighter
  #   bio_ups: ups_off + heavy battery
  #   bio_ears: earplugs
  #   bio_tools:
  #     - NOT small_repairkit/large_repairkit!
  #     - NOT tailors_kit!
  #     - NOT clamp/locking_pliers
  CBMs:
    - bio_metabolics  # Get power from food- avoid going overweight? -- MUTATION CONFLICTS!
    - bio_cable  # Get power from solar backpack & running cars. no mutation conflicts
    - bio_ups  # Power laser rifles &c from yourself no mutation conflicts
    - bio_flashlight  # Heavy flashlight (NOTES-illumination.csv) no mutation conflicts
    # FIXME: consider bio_multimeter (split from bio_tools in 0.H, I think?)
    - bio_painkiller            # no mutation conflicts
    - bio_ar

# bio_ears → SAFECRACK_NO_TOOL
# bio_ears → DEAF (useful for sleeping)
# bio_blindfold → BLIND (useful for sleeping)
