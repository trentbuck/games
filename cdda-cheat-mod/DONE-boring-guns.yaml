        # RARE CALIBRES
        # ########################################
        # For just bumbling around having fun,
        # it's nice to have stuff that shoots the most common rounds.
        # These are 5.56×45mm NATO, 9×19mm Luger, and 00 shot.
        # Fuck these calibres:
        #
        #   .50 Beowulf
        #   .303 British
        #   5.7 (guns keep jamming for some reason???)
        #   7.62×53mmR (Mosin)
        #   7.62×39mm (AKM)
        #   5.45×39mm (AK-74)
        #   .30 Carbine (M1 Carbine)
        #   .30-06 (M1 Garand, Springfield)
        #   .32, .380, ,38, .454, .460
        #   .45 Colt (NOTE: not the same as .45 ACP!)
        #   4.6mm (HK MP7)
        #   .300 BLK
        #   .357 SIG
        #   700 NX
        #   7.62×25 (Tokarev)
        #   45-70 Government
        #   .50 BMG (maybe keep this one?)
        #
        # UPDATE: the M1 .30 Carbine is pretty fun, it's in-between
        #         PCCs and 2-line carbines.
        #         But it's entirely the one gun and one magazine.
        #
        # Likewise the most common magazines are STANAG (up to 150rd).
        # Fuck these guns with custom magazines:
        #
        #   S&W 22A
        #   AUG
        #   BAR
        #   Bren 2
        #   Browning BLR
        #   Hi-Point *
        #   Walther *
        #   HK *
        #   Vector SMG
        #   M3, M9, M11, M17, M18
        #   FN *
        #   Ruger Mini-14
        #   SIG (except the Stg 553)
        #
        # The 7.62×51mm NATO (M80) is kinda nice in an
        # M14 EBR or something that takes FAL 30rd mags?
        # Or just in an belt-fed single-shot M60 Civilian?
        # I tried putting a single-shot trigger into an M249, but
        # it broke right away.
        #
        # The American-180 is fun for leaving on burst
        # and just burning through weak zombies.
        #
        # I kinda want to just have a complete collection
        # of glocks, just so I can occasionally have fun
        # throwing a bunch of random pistol cartridges
        # downrange?  The COP Derringer was also fun for this.
        #
        # When I've been just throwing random bullets downrange,
        # I found that the FMJ is better.  Typically it's -2dam +10AP,
        # which lets me push over SWAT dudes in 1 shot instead of 2.
        #
        # UPDATE: American 180 goes away in CDDA 0.I.

        # ===== 9x19mm Luger =====
        # glock/ksub2000 have biggest 9x19mm mag (100).
        # ksub200 has highest damage and range
        # mp5/mp5sd is only 9x19 with burst (cf. auto).  I think it's only got a high price_postapoc because of a few years ago when sound and "night raids" were viable
        # Because I'm cheating and carrying *all* the guns at once, I almost never bother with burst first; I just switch to a bigger calibre.
        # So *I* don't actually care about burst at all, I think.
        # What I *do* like is having >50 rounds in a magazine so I can just dump rounds into a horde of mooks.
        # NOTE: I didn't notice for a long time, but the bulky mags
        #       often have an invisible jam probability multiplier of 2.0x.
        #       Is it worth going back to smaller mags with COMPACT_MAG and regular jam rate?
