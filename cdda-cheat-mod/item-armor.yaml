  # Try to take a middle-ground between "precise but verbose" and "short but sloppy".
  # Start with a baseline covering "all" body parts, like
  #   * fabric 100% thin skintight
  #   * mail    95% flexible normal
  #   * plate   80% rigid outer
  # Additional notes:
  #   * Avoid any encumbrance for mouth (stamina) or fingertips (crafting)!
  #     Uparmor backs of hands, downarmor fingertips?
  #   * Give the eyes see-through material?
